C data structure project(heap)

This is project for implementation of heap data structure(min heap).
The problem statement is: When we go to a medical store for buying medicines chemists first checks if the medicines are available or not.
If the medicines are not available then he/she will be placing the order for that medicine, resulting in delay in providing medicines to customer.

Solution: This issue can be overcomed by creating a heap(min heap) of medicines w.r.t the stocks available. So as soon as the stock of a certain medicine
goes below the threshold value it will be removed from heap and will be placed in the order list.
